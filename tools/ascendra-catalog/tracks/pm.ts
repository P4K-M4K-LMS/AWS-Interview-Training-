// PM certification tracks -- Strand 2 of docs/catalog-backlog.md, opened
// 2026-09-26 right after the CompTIA-remainder strand closed out. Follows the
// AWS/Azure/GCP/CompTIA credential-block pattern (see comptia.ts's header for
// why that's the current standard, vs. data.ts's older untagged style).
//
// Primary body: PMI (pmi.org). Every domain/task below was read on
// 2026-09-26 directly from PMI's own current Examination Content Outline
// (ECO) PDFs -- not from training data, which would have been stale for PMP
// specifically: PMP's ECO was replaced in July 2026 (new 3-domain weights,
// consolidated to 26 tasks from the prior 35), and the old pmi.org PDF URL
// now serves the new document, not the 2021 one memory would expect. CAPM's
// ECO is the 2023 update, still current -- no rename/retirement found for it.
// Objectives below paraphrase each ECO's tasks/enablers, not copied verbatim
// (same copyright boundary AWS/Azure/GCP/CompTIA's tracks followed).
//
// PMI never publishes an exam code for any of its certifications (no
// CompTIA-style "PK0-005" equivalent) -- same shape as Google Cloud's
// certifications (REQ-040), so these use `vendor_exam_unpublished_code`
// rather than `vendor_exam`, and `examCode` stays unset.
