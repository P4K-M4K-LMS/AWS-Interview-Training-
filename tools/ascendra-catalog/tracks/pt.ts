// Physical therapy tracks: the two NPTE licensure examinations
// (Strand 3 of docs/catalog-backlog.md). Different shape from the
// vendor-cert tracks elsewhere in this repo -- these are state licensure
// exams, same modeling as nursing's NCLEX tracks (migration 014's
// regulatory_licensure basis), not a proctored vendor certification with an
// exam code a private company sells.
//
// Every domain name and item-count range below was read on 2026-09-27
// directly from FSBPT's own NPTE Candidate Handbook (Version 2025.02, the
// current cycle since the June 2022 practice analysis took effect January
// 2024) -- not a summary of it. FSBPT publishes item-count ranges per
// domain, not percentages (unlike NCSBN's NCLEX test plans) -- weight below
// carries each range's midpoint as a percentage of that exam's scored-item
// total, same technique nursing.ts already established for NCLEX's ranges;
// rangeLabel keeps FSBPT's own published range so the learner sees what the
// vendor actually promises, not just our derived number.
//
// Objectives are written in our own words from the content outline's body
// systems and process areas -- deliberately not copied, same rule the
// nursing tracks follow.
//
// Both tracks set requiresAcknowledgement: physical therapy content acted
// on in practice has patient-safety consequences, same as nursing.
