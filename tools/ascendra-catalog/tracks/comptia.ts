// for A+ would have been stale: training data's A+ pairing (220-1101/1102)

// 2025) before this was written. Objectives are paraphrased from each page's
// domain sub-topics, not copied, the same rule AWS/Azure/GCP's tracks followed.

// 90 minutes, max 90 questions (multiple choice, drag-and-drop,
